# Simple File System
This project is a simple file system that uses the FUSE library (https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) to emulate a disk. I wrote sfs_api.c and sfs_api.h, which provide the structures and api for disk operations. I also wrote the makefile. The rest of the files were provided as part of the assignment. A more in depth description of the project as well as more details regarding the api and the data structures created can be found within project_outline.pdf. 

*Note that the program was designed on and for the ubuntu systems at my school. It may not work on other systems, but was successfully executed on computers at school and received a 100%.
